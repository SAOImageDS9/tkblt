TkBLT is a library of extensions to the Tk library.  It adds new
commands and variables to the application's interpreter.

The following commands are added to the interpreter from the TkBLT library:

Graph

legend and annotations.   It has of several components; coordinate axes, 
crosshairs, a legend, and a collection of elements and tags.

Barchart
A barchart widget. Plots two-variable data as rectangular bars in a 
window.  The x-coordinate values designate the position of the bar along 
the x-axis, while the y-coordinate values designate the magnitude.
The barchart widget has of several components; coordinate axes, 
crosshairs, a legend, and a collection of elements and tags.

Vector 
Creates a vector of floating point values.  The vector's components
can be manipulated in three ways: through a Tcl array variable, a Tcl
command, or the C API.
